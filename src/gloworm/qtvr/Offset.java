      1) Make the constructor take the container which the offset is
      relative to (and enforce it with a NullPointerException).  Most
      extensible for dealing w/relative offsets into an arbitrary
      container (if can evade the tendency of defensive-copying
      Writables to screw them up), but inflexible: the width may be
      known where/when the specific container instance isn't.

      2) Make the constructor take a boolean re whether the
      container's wide.  Doesn't help or hurt extensibility for
      arbitrary containers (there has to be a method that lazily sets
      the container), more flexible, and you know at compile time if
      you transposed the parameters. */
